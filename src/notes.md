try to make a join on the data coming from the apis cuz i wanna display the ingredients on the card itself 
figure the cors issue out , you prolly have to make a backend and have the api calls in it and render the frontend by making a call to the server
a youtube video is open for the same and we have the sample code in recipe_backend
make a page for each one of the drinks
